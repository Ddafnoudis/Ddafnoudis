### ðŸ‘‹Hello I'm Dimitris. 

I am a **MSc student in Applied Bioinformatics** at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. I have been practicing bioinformatics and cancer research for about 1.5 years and I'm passionate about genomics, trancriptomics and metatrascriptomics. How do I manage with those Giants? Well.. I utilize a box called  the "bioinformatic toolchain" using R, Python and Bash for tasks such as Next Generation Sequencing analysis, scRNA-seq analysis, machine learning etc.
